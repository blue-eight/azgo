azgo is a simple CLI tool that demonstrates the use of Azure from the Go programming language.

The CLI is built using the [spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) library.

The azgo CLI lives under `azgo/` as we may add other tools and libraries to this repo.

Packages in azgo are designed to be easy to borrow snippets of code from. However, most are to demonstrate to do not guarantee production-readiness. 

Many packages have been extracted from various SDK samples, tests, etc. They typically utilize a very small subset of a given SDK, package, or service. We make efforts to align different programmatic interfaces to provide a semi-consistent CLI interface along the way.

The repo is most often used to work with, and discuss, the code. Documentation is often a Work In Progress.

Feedback, questions, and contributions of every kind are always welcome!
